# Buffon-s-needle-problem
This repository contains a Python implementation of Buffon's Needle algorithm to estimate the value of π. The implementation attempts to handle both cases (z ≤ D and z > D) based on the length of the needle and the distance between the plates. It uses Monte Carlo simulation for estimating π through random throws.
